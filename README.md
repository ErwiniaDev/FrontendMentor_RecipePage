## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Table revision.
Mobile first!

### Continued development

OLD - I still have differences with spaces (paddings, margins, ...), used blocs and units I think.
EDIT - I have corrected the spaces, but I have coded the mobile and desktop versions separately... And I'm not sure that is optimal. I hope I haven't duplicated code... And I always hesitate for the choice of the units (rem, px, ...).

### Useful resources

- still the Modern CSS Reset of Andy Bell : https://dev.to/hankchizljaw/a-modern-css-reset-6p3
